    <i>"[O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity [...] whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes."</i><br>—<a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.aspx">The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath by H.P. Lovecraft</a><br><br>Azathoth, sometimes called "The Blind Idiot God", the "Nuclear Chaos", the "Daemon Sultan", "The Deep Dark", and "The Cold One", is a fictional deity in the Cthulhu Mythos--portrayed as an Outer God and a supreme omnipotent being. There is evidence the physical manifestation of Azathoth in the universe is continuous with a spot in the central region of the galaxy, otherwise known as Sagittarius A* - the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.<br><br><br></p>

  <p><i>"They were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape [...] but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them."</i>—<a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx">The Call of Cthulhu by H.P. Lovecraft</a><br><br>It is unknown how large the throng of those who worship the dreaded Cthulhu is, but his cult has many cells around the globe. The cult is noted for chanting its horrid phrase or ritual: "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn," which translates as "In his house at R'lyeh dead C'thulhu waits dreaming." When the creature finally appears, the story says that the "thing cannot be described," but it is called "the green, sticky spawn of the stars", with "flabby claws" and an "awful squid-head with writhing feelers."<br><br></p>

  <div class="c"><h2>Dagon</h2></div>
  <p><i>"Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad then. [...] In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given scant attention."</i>—<a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/d.aspx">Dagon by H.P. Lovecraft</a><br><br>Dagon is a deity from Mesopotamian mythology who was incorporated into H. P. Lovecraft's fiction in the short story "Dagon", eventually becoming a prominent element of the Cthulhu Mythos, where he is often referred to as Father Dagon. In the stories of Lovecraft and others, he presides over the Deep Ones, a hidden amphibious humanoid race that resides in the Earth's oceans, and is worshipped by the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a secret cult based in Innsmouth. He is the consort of Mother Hydra.<br><br></p>

</div>
    <div class="d"><h2>Nyarlathotep</h2></div>
<p><i>"And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger."</i><br>—<a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/n.aspx">Nyarlathotep by H.P. Lovecraft</a><br><br>Nyarlathotep differs from the other deities in the Mythos in a number of ways. Most of the Outer Gods are exiled to the stars, like Yog-Sothoth and Azathoth, and most of the Great Old Ones are sleeping and dreaming like Cthulhu; Nyarlathotep, however, is active and frequently walks the Earth in the guise of a human being, usually a tall, slim, joyous man. He has "a thousand" other forms and manifestations, many reputed to be quite horrific and sanity-blasting. Most of the Outer Gods have their own cults serving them; Nyarlathotep seems to serve as He serves several cults and takes care of their affairs in the other Outer Gods' absence.<br><br></p>

    <div class="e"><h2>Shoggoths</h2></div>
<p><i>"Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes - viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells - rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile - slaves of suggestion, builders of cities - more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and more imitative! Great God! What madness made even those blasphemous Old Ones willing to use and carve such things?"</i><br>—<a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/mm.aspx">At The Mountains of Madness by H.P. Lovecraft</a><br><br>A shoggoth is a sentient blob of self-shaping, gelatinous flesh, something like a giant amoeba. A shoggoth is some 15 feet in diameter if it shaped itself into a sphere, but larger and smaller versions exist. A shoggoth is capable of shaping itself into whatever organs or shapes it finds necessary at the moment; however, in its usual state it tends to sport a roiling profusion of eyes, mouths, and pseudopodia. When encountered at the South Pole, it moved at incredible speed.<br><br></p>

    <div class="f"><h2>Tsathoggua</h2></div>
  <p><i>"[In] that secret cave in the bowels of Voormithadreth... abides from eldermost eons the god Tsathoggua. You shall know Tsathoggua by his great girth and his batlike furriness and the look of a sleepy black toad which he has eternally. He will rise not from his place, even in the ravening of hunger, but will wait in divine slothfulness for the sacrifice. And, going close to Lord Tsathoggua, you must say to him: "I am the blood-offering sent by the sorcerer Ezdagor.'"</i>—<a href="http://www.eldritchdark.com/writings/short-stories/192/the-seven-geases">The Seven Geases by Clark Ashton Smith</a><br><br>Tsathoggua is often found asleep. He is incredibly lazy and refuses to leave his chambers unless mortally threatened. If disturbed, he will eat him unless the awakener has a sacrifice to offer; in which case, Tsathoggua will eat the sacrifice instead and then fall back into hibernation. However, there are exceptions.<br><br>
